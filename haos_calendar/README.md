## Notes

- Make sure the custom cards `custom:week-planner-card` and `custom:button-card` are installed in Home Assistant via HACS or manually.
- The dashboard assumes an `input_select` called `calendar_subtab` exists with options `daily`, `2 week`, and `monthly`.
- You can adjust `days` and `startingDayOffset` to control the displayed range of the calendar.
- The `dayFormat` property can be customized for larger or styled day numbers.
